My name is Joris den Uijl. I graduated as a [hydraulic engineer from TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/hydraulic-engineering/) in January '18. During my study I got more and more interested in "tech". I started reading Hacker News, following ProductHunt and taught myself Python programming. After my graduation I worked one year as a quantitave consultant in finance. Although I liked finance, I was happy to receive a call from my former graduation supervisor and was able to join a [large marine contractor](https://www.vanoord.com/ "Van Oord") as a Data Engineer. In this function I try to enable data driven decision making in large construction projects.

I like data science/analytics/visualisation and python so most of my _projects_ will comprise either analysing data or obtaining data. I'll post all code as python notebooks on [GitHub](https://github.com/uijl/uijl.github.io_code "GitHub of Joris").
