I plan to keep a list of the books I have read since past year.

### 2019

I am reading the following book:

- [**Rich Dad, Poor Dad - Robert Kiyosaki.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/69571.Rich_Dad_Poor_Dad) On his podcast the author seems to be very arrogant, I do not know yet if his book will be similar.

I have finished only one book yet:

- [**The Richest man in Babylon - George Clason.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/82101.Richest_Man_in_Babylon_and_The_Magic_Story) Both this book and Rich Dad, Poor Dad get recommended often if you want to learn more about becom financially independent, but I do not find it that insightfull. It basically comes down to three things: Do not spend more than you earn / have, Save at least 10% of income, Make your money work for you.
- [**The Black Swan - Nassim Nicholas Taleb.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The_Black_Swan) I enjoy the insights and the way of thinking that Taleb presents.

### 2018

Unfortunately this list is not as long as I hoped it would be.

- [**Sapiens - Yuval Noah Hariri.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens) I read this Book, just like everyone else. But unlike most people, I found it kind of hard to get through.
- [**Moneyball - Michael Lewis.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball) I like the books by Michael Lewis, I have read two books by him this year.
- [**Born a Crime - Trevor Noah.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime) Loved it.
- [**Liar's Poker - Michael Lewis.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7865083-liar-s-poker) The second book of Michael Lewis that I read in 2018.
- [**The Sellout - Paul Beatty.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22237161-the-sellout) I do not think that I understood it. It was very fun, and I love satire, but I feel like I missed something.
- [**Against the Gods - Peter Bernstein.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/128429.Against_the_Gods) Interesting book on the definiting of risk and probability throughout the modern times.
- [**Origin - Dan Brown.**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32283133-origin) The only true novel I read this year. I always like to books by Dan Brown, with recurring patterns of symbolics and art history.
